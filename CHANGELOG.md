## 2025-12-16

### Fixed
- **SAP C4C search filtering now works correctly** - AI agents now use the correct OData V2 filter syntax for partial name searches (substringof instead of contains) and correct field names for opportunity filters (ProspectPartyID instead of AccountPartyID)

## 2025-12-12

### Added
- **Experimental skill banner** - Skills marked as experimental now display a warning banner on their setup page, informing users that features may change
- **Projektron session expiration notice** - Projektron skill setup page now shows a note near the JSESSIONID and CSRF token fields explaining that these values expire after a day

## 2025-12-05

### Added
- **Projektron absence tracking** - AI agents can now view vacation, sickness, and other absences for any year with details including dates, duration, status (approved/pending/rejected), and vacation balance summary
- **Projektron worklog debug script** - New helper script (`scripts/projektron_add_worklog_helper.sh`) for testing and debugging Projektron time bookings from the command line
- **Integration connection status tracking** - Integrations now track their connection status and display when credentials need to be renewed

### Fixed
- **Projektron absence details now parse correctly** - Fixed a bug where vacation entries showed null values for duration, end date, and status; multi-day vacations now correctly display their full date range (e.g., Dec 22-31 instead of just Dec 22)
- **Projektron time entries now book to correct date** - Fixed a bug where time entries were being booked to the wrong date (one day earlier than intended) due to an incorrect date adjustment in the booking logic

## 2025-12-04

### Added
- **Execution ID tracking in Audit Log** - API calls can now be grouped by execution_id parameter, making it easier to trace all actions from a single AI agent workflow execution
- **Audit Log grouped view** - New toggle between flat and grouped view modes, allowing you to see related API calls collapsed under their execution_id
- **Execution ID filtering** - Filter audit log entries by specific execution_id to trace a single workflow execution

### Changed
- **Audit Log now shows last 15 minutes by default** - For better performance and focus, the audit log initially displays only the last 15 minutes of entries; use the date filters to view older logs
- **Audit Log table layout optimized** - Removed User column to make room for Data column on smaller screens

### Fixed
- **Audit Log expand details now scrollable** - Large JSON data in expanded log details is now scrollable instead of expanding infinitely

## 2025-12-03

### Added
- **SAP C4C metadata discovery tool** - AI agents can now discover available entity properties before searching, preventing filter errors from invalid property names like "SalesPhaseCode" that don't exist in the OData API
- **SAP C4C related data expansion** - AI agents can now include related collections (parties, items, notes) in opportunity queries with a single request, reducing API calls
- **SAP C4C automatic date format correction** - AI agent now automatically converts simple dates (e.g., "2026-03-03") to SAP's required ISO 8601 format with time component ("2026-03-03T00:00:00") without asking for user confirmation

### Improved
- **Multi-language response consistency** - Main AI agent now correctly responds in the same language as the user's input (English input → English response, German input → German response)

### Fixed
- **SAP C4C opportunity creation 403 error** - Fixed issue where creating opportunities failed with "permission denied" due to session cookies being lost during CSRF token fetch redirect; CSRF token endpoint now avoids redirect for reliable session handling
- **SAP C4C opportunity creation with account/contact links** - Fixed issue where linking opportunities to accounts and contacts failed due to wrong SAP field names (AccountPartyID→ProspectPartyID, MainContactPartyID→PrimaryContactPartyID) and wrong ID types; now correctly uses AccountID/ContactID instead of ObjectID
- **SAP C4C account/contact lookup from opportunities** - Fixed issue where agent incorrectly used PartyID values to fetch accounts and contacts, resulting in 404 errors; agent now uses name-based search for reliable lookups

### Changed
- **Projektron time booking requires CSRF token** - Users must now provide their CSRF_Token cookie alongside JSESSIONID for worklog booking; this improves reliability by using the browser's existing token instead of trying to extract it from HTML

## 2025-12-01

### Added
- **Release Notes page** - New page displaying changelogs from all Workoflow components (Bot, Platform, Tests, Load Tests, Infrastructure) with GitHub links and project descriptions

- **Format clarification prompts** - For ambiguous requests like "Erstelle Unterlagen", the agent asks which format you prefer instead of guessing

### Fixed
- **PDF/PowerPoint format confusion** - Fixed issue where requesting a "Präsentation in Form einer PDF Datei" would incorrectly create a PowerPoint instead of respecting the explicit PDF request

### Improved
- **Detailed API error messages** - Tool execution errors now include specific error details, HTTP status codes, context (tool_id, tool_name, integration_type), and actionable hints for troubleshooting
